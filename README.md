## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.\*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What characteristics do ‘tech professionals’ have in common?
2. Do those characteristics influence job satisfaction?
3. Do those characteristics salary?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook which is an EDA through the data pertaining to the questions.

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

There is a csv file which is the dataset to work with.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@phuonganhdang271000/how-tech-professionals-preferences-shape-salaries-and-job-satisfaction-6a92f7727815).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
